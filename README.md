### Hi there 👋

🤖 Android developer for 4 years now, I had the chance to work in team, with several companies of different sizes (large accounts, start-ups, ...).

💻 I am very attentive to the business needs in order to meet the various economic challenges and to be able to quickly put into production a resistant and reliable solution.

💪 In addition, having already worked on various large-scale projects, I have no difficulty entering easily and quickly into the source code of an existing project.

🤓 I like elegant and efficient code, which is why I am very sensitive to good development practices, software craftsmanship and architecture. (OOP, Design pattern, SOLID, TDD, BDD ...).

🥋 As part of a team, I enjoy organizing programming sessions (kata) to allow everyone to learn and pass on their coding knowledge. These exercises help the teams to harmonize on development practices and to gain competence.

🎯 I am also a Dart mentor on the [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/profiles/Corentin-Leffy) site to help students learn a new language while solving small programming problems. I have currently supported more than 400 students 🎉

I can bring you my expertise at an operational level:
- 🚀 project start-up, MVP
- 📝 feature development & bug fixes on an existing project
- 🤖 Android application development
- ✅ strategy of automated tests, refactoring and reduction of technical debt

Do not hesitate to contact me, I will answer you with pleasure as soon as possible

Corentin
